## Storybook Rebuild Plan
*(Note: Previous rebuild marked complete, but re-evaluating due to outdated stories)*

**Motivation**:
The current Storybook implementation does not match the current component implementations, lacks proper documentation, and does not demonstrate responsive behavior or theme integration.

**Goals**:
1. Update all component stories to match current implementation
2. Ensure all stories demonstrate responsive behavior where applicable
3. Add proper documentation to all stories
4. Ensure all stories demonstrate theme integration
5. Add story variants for different states and configurations

**Tasks**:

**Atomic Components**:

  - Update to use MUI button theming
  - Add stories for all button variants and states
  - Document props and usage

- [x] Input Component Stories
  - Update to reflect MUI TextField integration
  - Add stories for all input states (error, disabled, etc.)
  - Document props and usage

- [x] MarkdownRenderer Component Stories
  - Update to ensure theme integration via decorator
  - Verify GFM feature demonstrations
  - Document props and usage

**Molecular Components**:
- [x] MessageBubble Component Stories

  - Add stories for different message roles (user, assistant, system)
  - Document props and usage

- [x] ChatInput Component Stories
  - Update to match current implementation
  - Add stories for multiline support
  - Document props and usage

- [x] AgentToggle Component Stories

**Organism Components**:
- [x] ChatMessagePanel Component Stories
  - Update to use current Message interface
  - Add stories for different message combinations
  - Document props and usage

- [x] ChatHeader Component Stories
  - Update to demonstrate responsive behavior
  - Add stories for different agent modes
  - Document props and usage

- [x] ChatInputArea Component Stories
  - Update to match current implementation
  - Add stories for loading states
  - Document props and usage

- [x] ChatHistoryPanel Component Stories
  - Update to use current chat history interface
  - Add stories with varying numbers of history items
  - Document props and usage
  
**Template Components**:
- [x] ChatPageLayout Component Stories
  - Create stories that demonstrate the complete chat interface
  - Show different states (loading, error, empty)
  - Document props and usage

**Current Status**:
~The Storybook rebuild is complete! ‚úÖ All component stories have been updated to match the current implementation, demonstrate responsive behavior, and provide proper documentation. üéâ~
**Status**: Atom stories updated. Molecule, Organism, and Template stories require review and updating.

**Next Steps**:
1. Run the Storybook to verify all components render correctly
2. Consider adding interaction tests for key components
3. Keep the stories up-to-date as the application evolves

## Testing Markdown Support

### How to Test Markdown Formatting

To test the markdown formatting capabilities in the chat UI:

1. **Launch the application** at http://localhost:3001 (or your current port)

2. **Trigger a markdown demo** using one of these methods:
   - **Direct trigger phrases**: Type any of these messages in the chat input box and send:
     ```
     show me markdown formatting
     how can I use formatting in messages?
     what markdown features are supported?
     ```
   - The system will automatically respond with a comprehensive markdown demo showing various formatting options including headings, lists, code blocks, tables, and more.

3. **Explore sample chats**:
   - Look for these predefined chats in the chat history panel (left sidebar):
     - "Standard: Markdown Demo" - Shows basic markdown formatting examples
     - "Multi-Agent: Markdown Features" - Displays how different agents use markdown with their specialized styles
   - Click on these chats to load them and view the markdown examples

4. **Test the text size controls**:
   - Find the "A" (text size) icon in the top-right corner of the chat panel
   - Click it to open the size menu
   - Select from three options: Small, Medium, or Large
   - See how the markdown formatting adapts to different text sizes
   - The setting persists between sessions using localStorage

5. **Verify rendering of specific features**:
   - **Headings**: Check that headings are properly sized and styled
   - **Lists**: Verify both ordered and unordered lists work, including nesting
   - **Code blocks**: Confirm syntax highlighting works in code blocks
   - **Tables**: Check that table formatting is maintained
   - **Blockquotes**: Verify blockquotes are properly indented and styled
   - **Links**: Test that links are clearly visible with the purple styling

### Markdown Features Supported
- Headings (levels 1-6)
- Text formatting (bold, italic, strikethrough)
- Lists (ordered, unordered, nested)
- Code (inline and blocks with syntax highlighting)
