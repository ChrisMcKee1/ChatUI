## Decisions & Considerations
- Using Material UI's responsive utilities like useMediaQuery for consistent breakpoints
- Implementing compact mode for UI components to better support small screens
- Using fade transitions for loading states to improve perceived performance
- Using MutationObserver for detecting DOM changes during streaming responses
- Differentiating between smooth scrolling (normal updates) and immediate scrolling (streaming)
- Multi-agent responses are represented as an array of `Message` objects
- Theme files are now organized in a dedicated directory for better structure
- Using functional updates for state management to ensure atomic updates
- **Following an "architecture first" approach where diagrams are reviewed before implementation**
- **Ensuring architecture diagrams are kept up to date as the system evolves**
- **Implementing OpenTelemetry to gain better insights into application performance and user behavior**
- **Using OpenTelemetry's vendor-neutral approach to ensure flexibility with observability backends**
- **Rebuilding Storybook stories to align with current component implementations and architecture**
- **Ensuring consistent theming in Storybook that matches the application**
- **Using Next.js build configuration to ignore linting and type errors during deployment**
- **Using mock services for development deployments to avoid dependencies on external APIs**
- **Separating frontend and backend deployments for better modularity and independent scaling**
- **Documentation Style**: Embracing energetic, clear, concise GFM with well-placed emojis for all future documentation. üòä
- **Current State**: Application is considered feature-complete for this phase, stable, and deployed. Focus shifts to observability and final polish (testing, documentation, accessibility).
- **API Response Format Strategy:** Prioritize backend simplicity for Semantic Kernel users by recommending the return of native `ChatMessageContent` objects. The frontend `ApiChatService` will handle parsing the necessary fields from this richer structure. Non-SK users should adhere to the documented minimal format.
