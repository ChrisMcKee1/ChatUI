## Current Focus
- Setting up Storybook for component development.
- Creating the initial Atomic Design directory structure within `src/components`.

## Recent Activities
- Completed **Step 1: Project Setup & Initialization**:
    - Initialized Git repository with `main` and `develop` branches (Gitflow).
    - Set up Next.js project using `create-next-app` with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router, `src` directory, ESLint, and `@/*` import alias.
    - Integrated Memory Bank files, theme files, and original README (`README.old.md`) into the project structure.
    - Made the initial commit and switched to the `develop` branch.

## Next Steps
- Begin **Step 2: Storybook & Atomic Design Setup**:
    - Install necessary Storybook dependencies (`@storybook/react`, `@storybook/nextjs`, etc.).
    - Configure Storybook to work with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
    - Create the basic Atomic Design directory structure: `src/components/atoms`, `src/components/molecules`, `src/components/organisms`, `src/components/templates`.

## Decisions & Considerations
- Tailwind CSS is configured and integrated with the Next.js project.
- Using App Router and `src` directory structure for optimal organization.
- Using `@/*` for absolute imports to simplify imports across the project.
- Development proceeds on the `develop` branch per Gitflow workflow.
