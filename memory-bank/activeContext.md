# Active Context: ChatUI

## Current Focus
- **MUI Component Integration**
- Refactoring existing components to use Material UI components more extensively
- Using Lucide icons directly in components
- Ensuring consistent styling across components with Material UI's theming system
- Improving accessibility in both light and dark modes

## Recent Activities
- **Fixed Message Bubble Contrast Issues**:
    - Improved dark mode text contrast for AI messages for better readability
    - Maintained proper text coloring in light mode
    - Refactored color logic into helper functions for better maintainability
    - Ensured all text elements meet accessibility standards
- **Refactored MessageBubble to use MUI Components**:
    - Replaced div elements with MUI's Box, Typography, and Avatar components
    - Replaced custom styling with MUI's sx prop and theme-aware styling
    - Added a conversation example to Storybook to showcase message sequence
    - Replaced user icon SVG with Lucide's User icon for consistency
- **Simplified Icon Usage**:
    - Removed the Icon wrapper component
    - Updated all components to import and use Lucide icons directly
    - Components now use appropriate Lucide icons like `Send`, `MessageSquare`, and `Bot`
- **Implemented Core UI Library Integration**:
    - Installed Lucide.dev and Material UI dependencies (`lucide-react`, `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`).
    - Refactored Button component to use Material UI Button.
    - Updated ChatInput component to use Material UI TextField.
    - Created integrated ThemeProvider that combines our app theme with Material UI theming.
    - Fixed MUI theme integration with CSS variables by extracting computed values.
    - Updated application layout and Storybook to use the new integrated ThemeProvider.
- Completed **Step 4: Create Molecule Components**:
    - Implemented key molecule components like ChatInput, MessageBubble, and AgentToggle that use the atom components.
- Completed **Step 3: Create Basic Atoms**:
    - Implemented Button, Input, and Icon atom components with comprehensive Storybook stories.
    - Set up ThemeContext for light/dark mode support.
- Completed **Step 2: Storybook & Atomic Design Setup**:
    - Installed and configured Storybook with default settings for Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind.
    - Created the Atomic Design directory structure (`atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`, `templates`) within `src/components`.
    - Committed Storybook configuration and directory structure to the `develop` branch.
- Completed **Step 1: Project Setup & Initialization**:
    - Initialized Git repository with `main` and `develop` branches (Gitflow).
    - Set up Next.js project using `create-next-app` with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router, `src` directory, ESLint, and `@/*` import alias.
    - Integrated Memory Bank files, theme files, and original README (`README.old.md`) into the project structure.
    - Made the initial commit and committed Next.js setup to the `develop` branch.

## Next Steps
- **Component Refactoring**:
  - Refactor AgentToggle to use more MUI components
  - Update ChatInputArea with MUI styling and components
  - Continue updating Storybook stories for the refactored components
- Continue building organism components:
  - Create `ChatHistoryPanel` organism that displays a collection of MessageBubble components
  - Create `ChatInputArea` organism that combines ChatInput with the AgentToggle
- Create template components:
  - Implement `ChatPageLayout` template for the main chat page
- Build the main Chat Page
- Implement mock service integration

## Decisions & Considerations
- Material UI components are now being used more extensively in our molecules
- Lucide.dev icons are imported and used directly in components instead of through a wrapper component
- Complex components built on top of MUI still follow atomic design principles
- Using an integrated ThemeProvider that combines our existing theme context with Material UI's ThemeProvider
- Tailwind CSS is still being used alongside Material UI for additional styling customization
- Using App Router and `src` directory structure
- Using `@/*` for absolute imports
- Development proceeds on the `develop` branch
- Ensuring proper color contrast in all theme modes for accessibility
- ThemeContext is set up for light/dark mode toggling.
