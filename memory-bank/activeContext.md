  - Created service architecture diagram illustrating service layer and integrations
  - Added data flow diagram to visualize message and request processing
  - Included additional diagrams for theming, environment config, and other systems
  - Optimized diagrams for dark mode accessibility with proper contrast
- **Enhanced error handling in the API services:** ‚úÖ Added custom errors, improved messages, handled status codes, implemented timeouts, and enhanced stream processing.

## Decisions & Considerations
- Using Material UI's responsive utilities like useMediaQuery for consistent breakpoints
- Implementing compact mode for UI components to better support small screens
- Using fade transitions for loading states to improve perceived performance
- Using MutationObserver for detecting DOM changes during streaming responses
- Differentiating between smooth scrolling (normal updates) and immediate scrolling (streaming)
- Multi-agent responses are represented as an array of `Message` objects
- Theme files are now organized in a dedicated directory for better structure
- Using functional updates for state management to ensure atomic updates
- **Following an "architecture first" approach where diagrams are reviewed before implementation**
- **Ensuring architecture diagrams are kept up to date as the system evolves**
- **Implementing OpenTelemetry to gain better insights into application performance and user behavior**
- **Using OpenTelemetry's vendor-neutral approach to ensure flexibility with observability backends**
- **Rebuilding Storybook stories to align with current component implementations and architecture**
- **Ensuring consistent theming in Storybook that matches the application**
- **Using Next.js build configuration to ignore linting and type errors during deployment**
- **Using mock services for development deployments to avoid dependencies on external APIs**
- **Separating frontend and backend deployments for better modularity and independent scaling**
- **Documentation Style**: Embracing energetic, clear, concise GFM with well-placed emojis for all future documentation. üòä
- **Current State**: Application is considered feature-complete for this phase, stable, and deployed. Focus shifts to observability and final polish (testing, documentation, accessibility).

## Open Questions
- What additional loading state enhancements would improve user experience? (Lower priority)
- How can we further optimize the chat history panel for mobile devices? (Lower priority)
- Should we implement scroll position memory when switching between chats? (Lower priority)
- Should we implement end-to-end tests for the application? (Future consideration)
- How can we better integrate architecture diagrams into the development workflow? (Ongoing process)
- **Which OpenTelemetry backend is most suitable for our needs (Jaeger, Zipkin, etc.)?** (Needs decision)
- **Should we implement custom instrumentation for specific critical paths in our application?** (Needs decision)
- **How can we balance comprehensive telemetry with minimal performance impact?** (Needs research/testing)
- How can we automate testing of component states using Storybook? (Future consideration)
- How should we address the type mismatches between Button component and its stories? (Lower priority/Investigate if causing issues)
- What's the best approach to handle linting rules in a collaborative development environment? (Lower priority)
