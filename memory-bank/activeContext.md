## Decisions & Considerations
- **Storybook Refactoring Plan:** Systematically review and update all stories (`Atoms`, `Molecules`, `Organisms`, `Templates`) based on current component implementations and `.cursorrules` guidelines, followed by running the `test-storybook` script.
- **Tool Message Visibility**: Implemented with a toggle in the header, default hidden.
- **Tool Message Styling**: Implemented with distinct neutral background and "Tool" label.
- **Following Phased Plan**: Completed all phases for tool message visibility.
- **Architecture First**: Diagrams reviewed and updated.
- Using Material UI's responsive utilities.
- Implementing compact mode for UI components.
- Using fade transitions for loading states.
- Using MutationObserver for streaming scroll detection.
- Differentiating scrolling behaviors.
- Multi-agent responses handled correctly.
- Themes organized in dedicated directory.
- Using functional state updates.
- Ensured architecture diagrams are up to date.
- Implemented OpenTelemetry with Azure Monitor.
- Storybook stories rebuilt and aligned.
- Consistent theming in Storybook verified.
- Next.js build ignores lint/type errors for deployment.
- Mock services used for dev deployments.
- Separate frontend/backend deployments.
- **Documentation Style**: Energetic, clear, concise GFM with emojis. üòä
- **Current State**: Application is feature-complete for this phase, stable, and deployed. Focus shifts to testing, API documentation, and accessibility.
- **API Response Format Strategy:** Prioritizing Semantic Kernel `ChatMessageContent` return type for backend simplicity.

## Open Questions
- How to best represent complex JSON content within the `TOOL` message bubble? (Current: `<pre>`, future enhancement possible)
- What additional loading state enhancements would improve user experience? (Lower priority)
- How can we further optimize the chat history panel for mobile devices? (Lower priority)
- Should we implement scroll position memory when switching between chats? (Lower priority)
- Should we implement end-to-end tests for the application? (Future consideration)
- How can we better integrate architecture diagrams into the development workflow? (Ongoing process)
- **Which OpenTelemetry backend is most suitable for our needs (Jaeger, Zipkin, etc.)?** (Needs decision - Current: Azure Monitor)
- **Should we implement custom instrumentation for specific critical paths?** (Needs decision - Currently using auto-instrumentation + basic manual)
- **How can we balance comprehensive telemetry with minimal performance impact?** (Needs research/testing)
- How can we automate testing of component states using Storybook? (Future consideration)
- What's the best approach to handle linting rules in a collaborative development environment? (Lower priority)
- How can we improve the display of very long messages or code blocks in `MessageBubble`? (Future enhancement)
